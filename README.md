# Universal-Segment-Debugger
A debugger for Segment with comfort in mind

Existing debuggers for Segment are not comfy to use. They require too many clicks to get to the point and they don't expose enough data. This is an attempt to remedy the issue. 

Planned features: 
* [ ] Extension icon indicating whether Segment is detected
* [ ] Extension popup indicating basic info about the Segment library loaded
* [ ] Logging Segment events in the console in a structured way
* [ ] Config for allowing custom Segment endpoints instead of the default cdn.segment.com and api.segment.io
* [ ] More things pending.
